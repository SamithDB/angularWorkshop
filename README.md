# Angular Workshop

## Static Design 
Please find the static html pages inside [design](./design) directory. Design has been done using Bootstrap 4. Original - [startbootstrap.com](https://startbootstrap.com/)

Get familiar with the two web pages [home](./design/home.html) and [manage-courses](./design/manage-courses.html). Additionally there is form named [edit-course-form](./design/edit-course-form.html) which we will wrap inside a model and use to edit course details. 

To watch the design in the browser,
```
cd design
npm install
npm start
```    
Open http://localhost:3000/home.html or http://localhost:3000/manage-courses.html
